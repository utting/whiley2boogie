Issues to discuss with David
============================

How to run 'wy boogie' with assertions enabled?


Equality:
  1. type-specific equals tests?
  2. or just Boogie '=='?  Plus axioms for each open/closed record type?
    Second approach seems better.
    1: does not handle recursive types (easily?)
    1: with open records, not possible to statically know the valid fields.

    2: will need stronger (equivalence) axioms for array equality, etc.
       (Boogie says it does not offer extensionality of maps!)
       Try issue 832.



Bugs?
  * wy compile sum0.whiley  does nothing if sum0.whiley is a symbolic link.
  * functions with no return values is a bug.
  * wy boogie ConstrainedReference_Valid_1.whiley (and wy compile) return status 0, but give this error:
    ./ConstrainedReference_Valid_1.whiley:7: expected reference type
            return (*v) + 1


Java 9: support?  Add GitHub issue, or pull request with changes.
  1 Need to add to build.xml, javac target: source="${JAVA_VERSION}"
    else get these compile warnings:

     I tried updating to:

	    // but >100 javadoc errors in WhileyCompiler project, so I commented out this dependency.



tests/valid/Process_Valid_7.whiley:
   needs extra requires and ensures to be verifiable?
  NO. But isRef needs to add types of referent.

   This verifies.
   But recently does not compile due to new {data: data}?
   type MyProc2 is &{int|bool data}

   method set(MyProc2 _this, int d)
   ensures _this->data == d:
       _this->data = d

   method get(MyProc2 _this) -> (int|bool r)
   ensures r == _this->data:
       return _this->data

   method create(int|bool data) -> (MyProc2 r)
   ensures r->data == data:
       return new {data: data}

   public export method test() :
       MyProc2 p2 = create(false)
       set(p2,1)
       int|bool result = get(p2)
       assume result == 1

  We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
  some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
  disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
  generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
